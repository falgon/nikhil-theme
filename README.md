# My blog theme

## Changes from source

* Fix all links to https
* [Since Pelican 3.7.0 changed the context variable called `PAGES` to `pages`](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/changelog.html#id2), it was corrected as it is not rendered properly as it is.
* Added search feature
* Added 404 page
* Added [pelican-dynamic](https://github.com/falgon/pelican_dynamic) plugin settings.
* Fix the stylesheet about mathjax. This problem was corrected because the class name of the style sheet for the theme built-in syntax highlight collides with the class name used by mathjax, and as a result the green formula was rendered.
